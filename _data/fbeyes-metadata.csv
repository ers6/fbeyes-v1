Born on a farm near Natchez, Mississippi, Wright began his literary career in big-city Chicago, where he joined the John Reed Club and the U.S. Communist Party. Increasingly dissatisfied by the Party, as well as by the earliest signs of the Second Red Scare, he moved to Paris in 1946. The FBI closely followed Wright’s progress, personal and professional, from 1942 through 1963, targeting his passport and keeping him on the Security Index of major threats to the U.S. even after his expatriation. Wright was highly conscious of FBI surveillance and police power more generally, addressing both in his unpublished Paris novel <i>Island of Hallucination</i> (1959) and in the pained but humorous poem “The FB Eye Blues” (1949). After he passed away in 1960, Ollie Harrington, Amiri Baraka, and other black radicals suspected that the FBI or CIA was responsible for Wright’s sudden death."

During his tenure at the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, the civil rights organization initiated many legal challenges to segregation including the successful Brown v. Board of Education suit of 1954. Earlier in his career, White had buoyed (and funded) the Harlem Renaissance, adding to its lists the novels Fire in the Flint (1924) and Flight (1926). His brave investigations of lynching—assisted by his light skin color—resulted in the non-fictional exposé Rope and Faggot: A Biography of Judge Lynch (1929). Though White was careful to keep a safe distance between the NAACP and the more radical elements of the black freedom movement, the FBI kept a file on him from 1943 to 1957, unusual in its documentation of close cooperation between an African American author and J. Edgar Hoover."

With Langston Hughes, Paul Robeson, and Richard Wright, he formed the Negro Playwrights’ Company in 1940. Known for his social realism and leftist politics, Ward spent much of his working life in Chicago and contributed to the city’s “post-Harlem” cultural renaissance. Under FBI scrutiny from 1944 to 1966, he was included on J. Edgar Hoover’s Security Index and discussed in what became a 289-page FBI file."

Fluent in French, he wrote and edited for the Agence France-Presse, the world’s oldest international news agency, when not authoring a string of English-language novels of black life: The Last of the Conquerors (1948), South Street (1954), and The Stone Face (1963). The FBI charted Smith’s progress beginning in 1951, playing havoc with his passport for several years.  The Stone Face, a pioneering depiction of anti-Arab racism, can also be considered an “antifile” answering such FBI interference. Probably unfairly, Richard Wright considered Smith the true author of the so-called Gibson Affair that divided black Paris in the late 1950s."
